                         ---------------------------
Build 1 (09-??-2000):
   This was the first build of the K7 engine and included no modications.
There are no existing copies of this version, due to the fact that it was
lost during development. Build 2 is the first real build of the K7 engine.

Build 2 (10-18-2000):
   The core foundation of the K7 engine is complete in this version and was
converted into a level editor with minimal effort for making maps. Build 1
of TED uses build 2 of the engine technology.

- working menu system
