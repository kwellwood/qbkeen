   Thankyou for downloading Commander Keen 7! This project is an attempt to
clone the original Keens 4-6 engine for creating new levels and to provide
a fully featured base platform engine to be used in other games. This is one
of the most advanced platform game engines ever written that can be found in
internet QB community. The source code included with this build is not
compilable (due to the libraries and complexity involved) but is included as
a learning guide for those ambitious enough to read my code! Sorry it isn't
commented, but I'm not writing it as a tutorial.

   The keys to play the game are as follows:

LEFT/RIGHT - Move player left and right
UP         - Aim up, climb up, grab pole, flip switch
DOWN       - Aim down, grab pole, climb down
CTRL       - Jump
ALT        - Toggle pogostick
SPACE      - Fire blaster pistol
PG UP/DOWN - Scroll screen up/down
A          - Set ammo to 50 (debug key)
F1         - Show engine counters (debug key)
F2         - Show player data (debug key)
F3         - Show scoreboard (ems disabled version)
F5         - Skip to next level (debug key)

   Make sure to run SETUP.EXE to setup your machine's sound system. If you
get an error message concerning memory when running keen7.exe, try running it
with the -noems parameter to disable EMS memory use (Some computers dont
allow access to it.) If the program keeps crashing randomly with error
70 (DS4QB), then you need to disable sound effects and possibly music. Sorry,
but this is a bug in DS4QB! Hopefully the author will update it soon.

   Enjoy playing the game and please contact me with any questions, comments,
or suggestions. Please share this game with other people! If you would like
to post the game on your webpage or upload it to someone else's page just let
me know where. It would be great if I could get this game to start
circulating more in the QB community! (Recognition is good. :)

   TED.EXE is the level editor which is being released starting with Build 13.
Documentation will be written for it later as well as the other tools not yet
released. Before editing a level, be sure to make a backup copy. The more
advanced features such as bridges, doors and lifts will probably not be
possible without documentation but feel free to play around with it and
explore the editor's capabilities.

   TED keys:
Arrows      - Scroll screen
-/=         - Zoom in and out
ESC         - Toggle menu bar
Left mouse  - Draw tile/place item
Right mouse - Grab tile
