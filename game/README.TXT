                          Using K7 Engine Build 6
                             By Kevin Wellwood

   This program is an attempt to replicate the Commander Keen engine from
the old Goodbye Galaxy trilogy. The graphics have been painstakingly cut from
screen shots but are exactly the same as the originals. I have never made a
platform-type game before, so the physics and clipping have been a little bit
of an adventure. Later I hope to put in sloping ground, more enemies, working
elevator pads etc. The engine code is broken up into fairly independent
modules for different functions such as weapons, player, enemies, rendering,
switches etc. New systems are added in easily making the engine very powerful
and easily modifiable for other types of games, and not just platform based.
I may release the source code later if there are requests.
