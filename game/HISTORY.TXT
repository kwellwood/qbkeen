                         ---------------------------
Build 1 (09-??-2000):
   This was the first build of the K7 engine and included no modications.
There are no existing copies of this version, due to the fact that it was
lost during development. Build 2 is the first real build of the K7 engine.

Build 2 (10-18-2000):
   The core foundation of the K7 engine is complete in this version and was
converted into a level editor with minimal effort for making maps. Build 1
of TED uses build 2 of the engine technology.

Changes since Build 1:
- clipping for the player
- working menu system

Build 3 (10-22-2000):
   The major addition in build 3 is a working physics system in progress. The
player uses 8 clip points spaced around the tile size of the player. Gravity
is present, although the player can jump up until he hits his head and comes
back down. All player artwork is new, and an animation system has been set up.
Looking much better than build 2 already. Future builds may look very good!

Changes since Build 2:
- 8 clip points on player
- all new player artwork
- player animation system
- physics partly working
- specific error messages

Build 3B (11-10-2000):
   This build was released because its at the end of several additions from
the previous builds and I want to move ahead with using real Commander Keen
artwork. That means future builds will use 16x16 tiles instead of 20x20.
All that requires, however, is to change the tile size variable in engine.dat
and redraw art. The physics system is now fully working with very few bugs.
Clip points on the player are no longer displayed and the map has been
changed some. The player is also no longer clipped by its tile size. The
size of the player frame and clip box are independent.

Changes since Build 3:
- map changes
- physics complete
- clip points independent of player tile size
- clip points not displayed
