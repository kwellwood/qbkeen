                         ---------------------------
Build 1 (09-??-2000):
   This was the first build of the K7 engine and included no modications.
There are no existing copies of this version, due to the fact that it was
lost during development. Build 2 is the first real build of the K7 engine.

Build 2 (10-18-2000):
   The core foundation of the K7 engine is complete in this version and was
converted into a level editor with minimal effort for making maps. Build 1
of TED uses build 2 of the engine technology.

Changes since Build 1:
- clipping for the player
- working menu system

Build 3 (10-22-2000):
   The major addition in build 3 is a working physics system in progress. The
player uses 8 clip points spaced around the tile size of the player. Gravity
is present, although the player can jump up until he hits his head and comes
back down. All player artwork is new, and an animation system has been set up.
Looking much better than build 2 already. Future builds may look very good!

Changes since Build 2:
- 8 clip points on player
- all new player artwork
- player animation system
- physics partly working
- specific error messages

Build 3B (11-10-2000):
   This build was released because its at the end of several additions from
the previous builds and I want to move ahead with using real Commander Keen
artwork. That means future builds will use 16x16 tiles instead of 20x20.
All that requires, however, is to change the tile size variable in engine.dat
and redraw art. The physics system is now fully working with very few bugs.
Clip points on the player are no longer displayed and the map has been
changed some. The player is also no longer clipped by its tile size. The
size of the player frame and clip box are independent.

Changes since Build 3:
- map changes
- physics complete
- clip points independent of player tile size
- clip points not displayed

Build 4 (11-20-2000):
   There are some major additions to build 4! Finally, its looking like
Commander Keen should. All artwork has been redone, with the exception of the
main menu, which will be changed in the near future. An items system has been
added, complete with animated candies and the points rising after they are
collected. The player is now clipped by 10 points, due to smaller tile sizes
to reduce bugs. DebugLog(t$) allows non-critical errors to be recorded and
greatly improves efficiency in bug hunting.

Changes since Build 3B:
- all new artwork!
- new tile size (16x16)
- animation in forest background
- items and sprites system
- debug message logging
- 10 clip points on player
- debug HUD shown with F1 key
- camera panned up and down with PG UP, DOWN

Build 5 (01-07-2001):
   The first build of the new year! Keen7 is not only looking like Keen but
feeling like Keen now too. The physics have really paid off. Physics.bas is
actually twice the size of K7.bas, the core module. Hopefully there will be
some new artwork in the next build with inclined slopes and maybe an enemy or
two. Things are rolling along beautifully! If only dqb wouldnt keep saying
the sound files were the wrong format. To flip switches, stand in front of
them and press the up arrow. To refill ammo to 50, just press 'a'.

Changes since Build 4:
- new player animation frames
- entirely new animation system
- weapons system complete
- switches system complete
- slight changes to HUD
- ammo pickup items

Build 6 (01-25-2001):
   Waited a while to put the finishing touches on this one. No inclined
slopes yet because I wanted to focus on getting atleast one enemy type in
there first so it might have a little play value. Ammo cheat has been removed.
Minor revisions of code have been made and its optimized in places where it
was getting cluttered. Also, all items except the keys (not used yet) have
been created and scattered around the map as a display. As a side note: the
switch is for display purposes. There are no objects attached to it yet. When
platforms come, they'll be able to be attached to switches.

Changes since Build 5:
- Title screen
- Basic player death handling
- Enemy system with the slug enemy!!
- Full compliment of items from keen 4

Build 7 (04-09-2001):
   Again, this build was a little slow. But finally slopes are now in the
engine and working. Both the player and enemies react to them. Unfortunately,
due to the nature of the tile engine, the slopes are checked graphically and
not mathematically. This slows things down a little bit but it should be ok.
As you may notice, the map has been completely redone from the last build. It
is actually an exact copy (so far) of the first level of Commander Keen 4, right
down to item placement! Now thats progress. :) Too bad the candy bars cant be
reached without Keen's trusty pogo stick. Hopefully that will come later along
with the underground part of the map. Stay tuned to qbcode.hypermart.net for
future builds!

Changes since Build 6:
- New play map
- Working slopes
- Some code optimization
- Map foreground tiles now overlayed on sprite objects
- More new artwork
- Foreground tiles can be superimposed on background tiles as a single
  background tile for objects like hills and houses, saving tile space.
