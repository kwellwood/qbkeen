   Thankyou for downloading Commander Keen 7! This project is an attempt to
clone the original Keen 4-6's engine for creating new levels and to provide
a fully featured base platform engine to be used in other games. This is one
of the most advanced platform game engines ever written that can be found in
the internet QB community. The source code included with this build is not
compilable (due to the libraries and complexity involved) but is included as
a LEARNING TOOL. Sorry it isn't commented, I just don't have the time or the
desire to fully document everything.

   The keys used in the game are as follows:

LEFT/RIGHT - Move player left and right
UP         - Aim up, climb up, grab pole, flip switch
DOWN       - Aim down, grab pole, climb down
CTRL       - Jump
ALT        - Toggle pogostick
SPACE      - Fire blaster pistol
ENTER      - Display the detailed status screen
PG UP/DOWN - Scroll screen up/down
A          - Set ammo to 99 (debug key)
F3         - Show scoreboard (ems disabled mode)
F5         - Skip to next level (debug key)

   If you receive an error message concerning memory when running keen7.exe,
try running it with the -noems parameter to disable EMS memory use (Some
computers dont allow access to it.) or if you are using windows xp, edit the
executable's properties to allow Auto EMS memory.

   Enjoy playing the game and please contact me with any questions, comments,
or suggestions. Please share this game with other people! If you would like
to post the game on your webpage or upload it to someone else's page just let
me know where. It would be great if I could get this game to start
circulating more in the QB community! (Recognition is good. :)

   TED.EXE (Tile EDitor) is the level editor which is being released starting
with Build 13. Documentation will be written for it later as well as the other
tools not yet released. Before editing a level, be sure to make a backup copy.
The more advanced features such as bridges, doors and lifts will probably not
be possible without documentation but feel free to play around with it and
explore the editor's capabilities.

   TED controls:
Arrows      - Scroll screen
-/=         - Zoom in and out
1/2         - Toggle layer visibility
T           - Shortcut to tile list
ESC         - Toggle menu bar
Left mouse  - Draw tile/place item
Right mouse - Grab tile
